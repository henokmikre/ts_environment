TS Environment
====================

Sets you up with a server environment on a Mac for Drupal development. If you need examples of how to install common packages with Homebrew, checkout environment_setup.sh

### Requirements:

 - [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12)
 - Xcode command line tools: `xcode-select --install`

Save a copy to your home folder and run ./environment_setup.sh.


Caveats:

-> After you set up, when you brew update, be very sure you know what Homebrew is telling you when it makes "helpful" suggestions.
